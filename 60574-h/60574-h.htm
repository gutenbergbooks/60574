<h2 id="c1">Foreword</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the Civil War, the United States
expanded the exploration of her western frontiers to gain a
measure of the vast lands and natural resources in the region now
occupied by our Rocky Mountain States. As part of this effort,
the Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories was
organized within the Department of the Interior, and staffed by
a group of hardy, pioneering scientists under the leadership of
geologist F. V. Hayden. During the summer of 1871, these men,
accompanied by photographer William H. Jackson and artist
Thomas Moran, made a reconnaissance geological study of the
legendary and mysterious &ldquo;Yellowstone Wonderland&rdquo; in remote
northwestern Wyoming Territory. The scientific reports and
illustrations prepared by Hayden and his colleagues, supplementing
the startling accounts that had been published by members
of the famous Washburn-Doane Expedition a year earlier, erased
all doubts that this unique land was eminently worthy of being
set aside &ldquo;for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.&rdquo; By Act
of Congress on March 1, 1872, our first National Park was
established.</p>
<p>During the past century, 50 million people have toured
Yellowstone National Park, marveling at its never-ending display
of natural wonders. No doubt many have paused to wonder about
the origin of these unusual and complex geological features&mdash;a
question, needless to say, that has intrigued and challenged
scientists from the very first days of the Hayden Survey. During
the past decade a group of U. S. Geological Survey scientists, in
cooperation with the National Park Service and aided by the
interest of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
remote sensing of the geologic phenomena, has been probing the
depths and farthest corners of the Park seeking more of the
answers. Some of the results of this work, and those of earlier
studies, are described in this book to provide a better understanding
and enjoyment of this great National Park.</p>

<p>The vivid descriptions brought back from the Yellowstone
country by the early explorers and trappers (see <a href="#pic1">frontispiece</a>),
whose reputations for telling tall tales were widely
accepted if not altogether deserved, fell upon the disbelieving
ears of the nation for more than half a century. Yet the intriguing
rumors persisted, and during the years 1869-71 several
expeditions staffed partly by scientists and engineers rediscovered
this unique region atop the backbone of our nation.
We now know that the earliest visitors, even if prone to exaggerate,
could not do justice to the long-hidden secrets of
Yellowstone, for none of them saw all of the fascinating
features that occur within this great National Park.</p>
<p>By the time the modern-day visitor enters Yellowstone
National Park through any of its five entrances, he probably
will have traveled through many parts of the Rocky Mountains
and grown somewhat accustomed to the &ldquo;lay of the
land.&rdquo; But this will in no way lessen the exciting impact of
viewing the natural wonders of Yellowstone for the first time.
Immediate attention, of course, is still drawn to the remarkable
array of geysers, hot springs, and other thermal phenomena
which in sheer numbers and variety are unsurpassed
throughout the world. But, as if these were not enough of an
attraction, nature has also provided an incredible setting of
sparkling rivers and lakes, thundering waterfalls and cataracts,
awesome canyons and gorges, and lofty glaciated mountain
peaks and extinct volcanoes. Truly this is a land apart,
a spectacular masterpiece of nature that fully deserves the
accolade of &ldquo;wonderland&rdquo; bestowed long ago by early explorers
and trappers. (See figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>.)</p>

<p class="pcap">YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK AREA, showing rivers, lakes, landforms, roads, towns,
settlements, and major geyser basins (stippled). The Park embraces 3,472 square miles
(2,221,770 acres), and its boundaries traverse a distance of nearly 300 miles. Yellowstone
Lake, with an irregular shoreline of 110 miles and a surface area of 137 square
miles, is one of the largest natural mountain lakes in the United States. (Fig. 1)</p>

<p>Beyond the first stirring impressions derived from the
grandeur of the vast Yellowstone wilderness and its myriad
wildlife, assuredly shared by people of all ages and from all
walks of life, the various aspects of the Park take on a very
different meaning for different individuals. The artist sees
grand vistas to be painted, the naturalist delights in the
flower-laden meadows and the native habitats of many kinds
of birds and animals, the engineer visualizes the amount of
energy stored in the waterfalls and steaming geysers, and so
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
on. To the geologist, in particular, who studies rocks and
fossils and all of the natural processes involved in shaping the
surface of the land, and to all those who would share such
interests, Yellowstone takes on a very special meaning. For
the Park is foremost a geological Park, created by an extraordinary
sequence of natural processes and events that have combined
to produce an immense outdoor laboratory for studies
that have contributed to a fuller knowledge and a better
understanding of the earth itself. The geological aspect of the
Yellowstone country is reflected by its very name, given long
ago to the river that issues from the great canyon of the
&ldquo;yellow rocks.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
This report, borrowing from a century of
scientific study within and around the Park area, describes
the geological &ldquo;how, why, and when&rdquo; of this unique and
fascinating region.</p>
<h3 id="c3">A geological preview</h3>
<p>Some 600,000 years ago the rumblings of an impending
volcanic eruption sounded ominously across the Yellowstone
country. Suddenly, in a mighty crescendo of deafening explosions,
tremendous quantities of hot volcanic ash and pumice
spewed from giant cracks at the earth&rsquo;s surface. Towering
dust clouds blackened the sky, and vast sheets of volcanic
debris spread out rapidly across the countryside in all directions,
covering thousands of square miles in a matter of minutes
with a blanket of utter devastation. Abruptly, a great
smoldering pit&mdash;a caldera 30 miles across, 45 miles long, and
several thousand feet deep&mdash;appeared in the central Yellowstone
region, the ground having fallen into the huge underground
cavern that was left by the earth-shaking eruptions.
Lava then began oozing from the cracks to fill the still-smoking
caldera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Thus, in one brief &ldquo;moment&rdquo; of geologic time there
was launched that incredible chain of events which led to the
creation of many of the natural wonders of Yellowstone National
Park. Heat from the enormous reservoir of molten
rock which produced the massive eruption still remains deep
within the earth beneath Yellowstone, sustaining the spectacular
hot-water and steam phenomena for which the Park
is so justly famous. The formation of the caldera and the
eruption of lavas profoundly influenced the shape of the
present-day landscape. Once a land covered almost entirely
by mountains, the part that collapsed&mdash;nearly one-third of
the total Park area&mdash;is now characterized by low rolling
plateaus formed from the thick lava flows that filled the caldera
(figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>; see <a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a> for the outline of the Yellowstone
caldera). Moreover, the carving of the spectacular Grand
Canyon of the Yellowstone (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>) and the fashioning of the
large interior basin now occupied by beautiful Yellowstone
Lake (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) were closely related to this mighty volcanic
event.</p>
<p>North, east, and south of the central plateaus are extensive
mountain ranges and other highlands which provide
much of the Park&rsquo;s scenic beauty (figs. <a href="#fig3">3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>). Formed by
many episodes of intense mountain building and ancient
volcanism, these uplands bear the lasting imprints of a wide
variety of geological activities that date back approximately
2.7 billion years. Indeed, as we study all the features of the
Yellowstone landscape, we find in them a most impressive and
fascinating story of that ageless conflict between the internal
forces of nature that raise the land through the upheaval of
mountains and the eruption of volcanoes, and the external
forces of erosion that wear the land down. It is this vast relentless
interplay of giant forces that determines the appearance
of any given place upon the earth&rsquo;s surface. And, in few other
places around the globe can the processes of both building up
and tearing down the landscape be illustrated more dramatically
than in Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<h3 id="c5">The nature of the rocks reveals their origins</h3>
<p>Geologists believe that &ldquo;the present is the key to the
past.&rdquo; After observing lava erupting from a present-day volcano
or limestone forming in marine waters, we infer that
similar types of ancient lavas or ancient limestones formed
in virtually the same ways. This kind of reasoning is used to
interpret the origins of all types of ancient rocks, for all the
known geological processes that form rocks seem to have been
operating since the earth&rsquo;s beginning.</p>
<p><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows the many different rock units that have
been recognized in Yellowstone National Park. Arranged in
a vertical column according to the geologic time intervals in
which they formed, these rocks represent a large part of total
earth history (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). A generalized geologic map (<a href="#map1">plate 1</a>)
shows the distribution of the various units (or groups of
closely related units) exposed at the surface throughout the
Park area. This map and <a href="#fig5">figure 5</a> summarize much of the
information that is necessary to interpret the Park&rsquo;s geologic
history&mdash;in essence, to provide answers to these two important
questions: What were the geologic events that formed the
rocks? When did these events occur?</p>
<h3 id="c6">The oldest rocks</h3>
<p>If we were to walk backward in time at the rate of one
century per step, the first step would return us to 1872, the
year that Yellowstone National Park was established. But to
return to the oldest recorded event in its geologic history,
we would have to walk (at 3 feet per step) some 15,000 miles,
or three-fifths of the way around the world! Occurring far
back in the antiquity of the Precambrian Era&mdash;approximately
2.7 billion years ago according to radiometric dating (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>)&mdash;the
oldest event resulted in rocks so crumpled and changed
by heat and pressure that their original character is obscure.
These rocks, having been transformed from still older ones,
are called <i>metamorphic rocks</i>. Considered to form part of
the very foundation of the continent itself, they are also commonly
referred to as <i>basement rocks</i>.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE ROCKS of Yellowstone National Park, separated into individual units or formations and arranged
according to their geologic ages (see <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). A formation is a body of rock that contains certain identifying
features (such as composition, color, and fossils) which set it apart from all other rock units.
The identifying features of each formation provide valuable clues bearing on its origin. Most formations
are given formal names, and usually each formation is thick and widespread enough to be recognized
over broad areas. Some, however, change character from place to place, and different names may be
used in different areas even though the rocks represent the same geologic time interval. (Fig. 5)</p><p class="center"><a class="ab1" href="images/strata_hr.jpg">High-resolution Version</a></p>

<p class="pcap">THE GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE&mdash;the &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; used by geologists in interpreting earth
history. Column A, graduated in billions of years (B.Y.) and subdivided into the four
major geologic eras (Precambrian, for example), represents the time elapsed since the
beginning of the earth, which is believed to have been about 4.5 billion years ago. Column
B is an expansion of part of the time scale in millions of years (M.Y.), to show the
subdivisions (periods&mdash;Cambrian, for example) of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic
Eras; column C is a further expansion to show particularly the subdivisions
(epochs&mdash;Paleocene, for example) of the Tertiary and Quaternary Periods. The principal
events in the geologic history of Yellowstone National Park are listed to the
right of column C, opposite the time intervals in which they occurred. The ages, in
years, are based on radiometric dating. Many rocks contain radioactive elements which
begin to decay at a very slow but measurable rate as soon as the parent rock is
formed. The most common radioactive elements are uranium, rubidium, and potassium,
and their decay (&ldquo;daughter&rdquo;) products are lead, strontium, and argon, respectively.
By measuring both the amount of a given daughter product and the amount of the
original radioactive element still remaining in the parent rock, and then relating these
measurements to their known rate of radioactive decay, the age of the rock in actual
numbers of years can be calculated. The decay of radioactive carbon (carbon-14) to
nitrogen is especially useful for dating rocks less than 40,000 years old. (Fig. 6)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Gneiss, a coarsely banded rock (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>), and schist, a
finely banded rock, are the most common kinds of metamorphic
rocks in Yellowstone. Originally, the gneiss probably
was granite, and the schist was a shale or sandstone. Outcrops
of the gneisses and schists occur only in the northern part of
the Park (<a href="#map1">pl. 1</a>), where they form the central cores of some
mountain ranges such as the Gallatin Range (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). They
also lie buried beneath younger rocks in many other areas of
the Park.</p>
<p>From the time of the metamorphic event, when the
gneisses and schists were formed, until the deposition of sediments
of the Cambrian Period (figs. <a href="#fig5">5</a> and <a href="#fig6">6</a>), there is virtually
no record. It is reasonably certain, however, that several
times during this 2.1-billion-year interval the region was
intensely squeezed and uplifted into high mountains and then
deeply eroded. By the end of Precambrian time, approximately
570 million years ago, the ancient Yellowstone landscape
had been reduced by erosion to a flat, stark, almost
featureless plain, which was soon to be flooded by a shallow
sea encroaching from the west. This very old surface is now
partly exposed in some places across the Buffalo Plateau, at
the north edge of the Park (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c7">The deposits of the shifting seas</h3>
<p>From the appearance of the rugged, mountainous terrain
of Yellowstone National Park, it is difficult to visualize a time
when this region lay close to sea level, at times even below
sea level. Yet the evidence is clear that from the Cambrian
Period to the latter part of the Cretaceous Period, a span of
about 500 million years, vast stretches of western lands were
flooded repeatedly by broad shallow seas that often reached
from Canada to Mexico (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). During these great floodings,
widespread horizontal beds of sand, silt, clay, limy mud, and
other sediments were deposited on the ocean floors, along the
adjoining beaches and wide tidal flats, and across the broad
flood plains of large rivers that emptied into the seas. All of
these ancient sediments have now hardened into compact
well-layered sandstones, shales, and limestones (figs. <a href="#fig9">9</a> and
<a href="#fig10">10</a>). These <i>sedimentary rocks</i> have been divided into 25 or
more distinct formations in the Yellowstone region (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>),
where they locally attain a combined thickness of more than
10,000 feet.</p>
<p>The first Paleozoic sea to reach the Yellowstone region,
some 550 million years ago, brought with it the earliest abundant
signs of life on earth. Small hard-shelled animals that
lived mainly on the shallow sea bottom are now preserved
as fossils in rocks deposited during the Cambrian Period.
Many of these animals were <i>trilobites</i>, long-extinct organisms
resembling today&rsquo;s crabs and spiders. Each younger set of
rocks or formations contains a different group of dominant
fossils, each diagnostic of that period of geologic time in
which they lived (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>).</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Fossils indicate the kind of environment in which the
animals lived (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). Some species thrived in the open
oceans; others thrived only along the beaches and in nearby
lagoons. Still others, such as the incredibly large dinosaurs
of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods, could survive only
on the land or in swamps. From studies of the fossils and of
the physical characteristics of the rocks in which they are now
found, the shoreline patterns of the shifting seas can be determined.
Studies show that the seas advanced and retreated
across the Yellowstone Park region at least a dozen times
during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Eras.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Mesozoic Era (in the latter part
of the Cretaceous Period), the metamorphic basement rocks
of Yellowstone lay covered by the vast blanket of flat-lying
sediments. Today, these sedimentary rocks are exposed along
the Snake River and its tributaries in the south-central part
of the Park, over much of the Gallatin Range in the northwest
corner, and at several places in the north-central and
northeastern parts (<a href="#map1">pl. 1</a>). Elsewhere, either they are hidden
from view beneath volcanic debris&mdash;ash and lava&mdash;that later
buried them, or they have been removed by erosion. But
wherever exposed, the original horizontal layers of sedimentary
rocks have been severely twisted and broken by later
mountain-building movements.</p>

<h3 id="c8">The first mountain-building episode</h3>
<p>Near the close of the Mesozoic Era the earth was subjected
to a series of intense crustal disturbances that geologists
call the Laramide orogeny (orogeny means mountain-building).
The origin and nature of the forces that bent and
cracked the crust are unknown, but current theories being
developed about sea-floor spreading and continental drift may
shed light on this major upheaval that began about 75 million
years ago. A significant effect of the Laramide orogeny was
the uplift and contortion of many of the mountain ranges
within what we today call the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>At the onset of the crustal disturbance, the gently rolling
landscape of the Yellowstone region began to warp and flex
into large upfolds (<i>anticlines</i>) and downfolds (<i>synclines</i>) (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>).
Gradually the mountain-building pressures increased,
finally reaching such magnitude that the limbs of the folds
could bend and stretch no further; thereupon, the rock layers
broke and were shoved over one another along extensive
<i>reverse faults</i>. The severely crumpled rocks within the Park
area can now be seen only along the north edge and in the
south-central part along the Snake River. In both places, the
folds and faults are especially well displayed by the layered
Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary formations (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>).</p>
<p>One of the most prominent Laramide structural features
is a large anticline in the north-central and northeastern
parts of the Park (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>, section B-B&prime;); the road from
Mammoth to the Northeast Entrance crosses much of this
feature (<a href="#map1">pl. 1</a>). Although originally forming a high mountain
mass, the anticline has been eroded so extensively that it no
longer appears mountainous (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). It displays a broad
core of Precambrian gneisses and schists and is bounded along
its southwest margin by a large reverse fault. Along the fault,
the ancient gneisses and schists have been shoved over rocks
as young as Late Cretaceous, a movement amounting to
10,000 feet or more. The Cretaceous rocks are those that are
now exposed at Mount Everts (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">COMMON KINDS OF GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES produced by deformation of the earth&rsquo;s
crust. An original horizontal rock layer may be upfolded into anticlines, downfolded
into synclines, and broken by either reverse or normal faults. A fault is a fracture
or a zone of fractures within the earth&rsquo;s crust along which movement has taken
place. A reverse fault is one generally produced by compression (squeezing together),
and the hanging-wall block has moved up with respect to the footwall block.
A normal fault is one generally produced by tension (pulling apart), and the hanging-wall
block has moved down with respect to the footwall block. All these kinds of
structures are present in Yellowstone National Park. (Fig. 13)</p>

<p>During the Laramide orogeny, many folds and faults
formed in the northwestern part of the Park, in the area now
occupied by the Gallatin Range (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>, section A-A&prime;). In
south-central Yellowstone, the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary
rocks were tightly folded into three anticlines separated
from one another by synclines and faults (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>, section
C-C&prime;). Movement along one reverse fault in this area
was locally more than 10,000 feet.</p>
<p>As the lands were uplifted and contorted, they came
under vigorous attack by the ever-present agents of erosion.
Tremendous quantities of rock were stripped from the highlands,
and the debris was carried by streams into the adjacent
lowland basins and deposited mostly as sand and gravel. As
the highlands continued to rise, the basins continued to sink,
and in a short period of time great thicknesses of basin-fill
sediments accumulated locally. One such deposit, the Harebell
Formation of latest Cretaceous age in south-central Yellowstone
(<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>), is more than 8,000 feet thick.</p>
<p>Other similar anticlines, synclines, and reverse faults no
doubt extend far into the interior of Yellowstone National
Park, and perhaps entirely across it in places, but they lie
buried beneath a thick capping of volcanic rocks. Nevertheless,
it seems safe to conclude that none of the Park area
escaped the effects of the great forces of the Laramide orogeny.
These forces, regardless of how they originated deep
within the earth, seem to have been compressional (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>),
pushing the upper layers of the earth&rsquo;s crust from the east
and northeast toward the west and southwest. This interpretation
is based on the style of the structural features just described,
which shows that the steep limbs of folds, as well as
the direction of movements along reverse faults, point toward
the west or southwest (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>).</p>
<p>By early Eocene time, about 20 million years after they
had begun, the deformational forces relaxed. But the effects
of the giant earth movements were to last for a very long
time. Crustal disturbances of such magnitude commonly produce
conditions deep within the earth which, in places, gives
rise to intense volcanic activity; one such place was Yellowstone.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Volcanic activity</h3>
<p>In early Eocene time, between 55 and 50 million years
ago, several large volcanoes erupted in and near Yellowstone
National Park. This volcanic activity resulted in the accumulation
of the vast pile of Absaroka volcanic rocks (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>)
which now makes up most of the Absaroka and Washburn
Ranges and part of the Gallatin Range, and which covers
several other smaller areas in the Park (<a href="#map1">pl. 1</a>).</p>
<p>What special geologic conditions would cause these spectacular
eruptions of molten rock at the earth&rsquo;s surface? Measurements
taken in deep mines and oil wells show that the
normal increase in the earth&rsquo;s temperature with depth is
about 1&deg;F per 100 feet. This heat is generated by the decay
of radioactive elements&mdash;chiefly uranium, thorium, and potassium&mdash;which
are present in at least small amounts in
virtually all rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust. Ordinarily, enough
heat is conducted to the earth&rsquo;s surface so that the deeply
buried rocks do not become hot enough to melt. In some
places, however, the heat is not carried off fast enough, and
the temperature rises slowly toward the melting point of the
rock. Such hot spots may develop (1) because the rocks in
those places contain more than an average amount of radioactive
elements; (2) because hotter material moves upward
from still deeper levels in the earth; or (3) because drastic
changes in pressure are brought about by the alternate
squeezing and relaxing of mountain-building forces, which
in turn substantially affect the melting point of the rocks.
Whatever the cause, the eventual result is the accumulation
of a huge body of molten rock, called <i>magma</i>, enclosed in a
deep underground chamber.</p>
<p>Magma, being a mixture of hot liquids and gases that is
lighter in weight than the solid rocks surrounding it, tends
to rise toward the earth&rsquo;s surface. Forcing its way upward,
some of the molten material solidifies before reaching the
surface and forms bodies of various kinds of <i>intrusive igneous
rocks</i> (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). Some of the magma, however, reaches the
surface and either pours out as lava or is blown out explosively
as rock fragments, ash, and pumice to form <i>extrusive
igneous rocks</i>.</p>

<p>The magmas which formed the Absaroka volcanoes
erupted mainly through large central vents (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>). Most
of the eruptions were fairly quiet, with the molten rock
welling up to the surface and cascading down the sides of the
volcanoes chiefly as viscous lava flows and breccias. Rain,
seeping into these porous rocks, caused huge landslides of
mud and broken rock to stream down the mountainsides.
Hence, many of the rocks seen today are volcanic breccias&mdash;jumbled
but crudely layered deposits of large and small
angular blocks embedded in a sandy matrix, much like man-made
concrete except that the rock fragments are considerably
coarser (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>). Viewed from a distance, however, most
of the breccia deposits have a distinct layered appearance
(<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). The predominant extrusive igneous rock in the
Absaroka volcanic sequence is andesite, but basalt also occurs
in places (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">ABSAROKA VOLCANOES and their rocks. Lava (mostly andesite) poured from central
vents and formed volcanoes, some steep sided and others broad and relatively flat.
As the lava spilled out, much of it quickly solidified, broke up into large angular
blocks (breccia), and then either tumbled down the slopes of the volcanoes as individual
boulders or slid down in mudflows and landslides. Some of the material was
also explosively blown out as rock bombs, cinders, and ash. The more fluid lava
(mostly basalt), on the other hand, flowed quietly down the volcanic slopes and onto
the surrounding lowlands. The rocks near the volcanic centers therefore include thick
crudely layered coarse breccias, thin fine ash and dust falls, and thin to thick lava
flows. The volcanoes were repeatedly attacked by erosion, and the eroded material
was redeposited by streams and mudflows in widespread layers of volcanic conglomerate
and sandstone across the flat-floored valleys and plains between the volcanoes.
Forests, which grew luxuriantly in these lowland areas, were repeatedly buried by
volcanic eruptions and are now preserved (see inset) as the fossil forests of Yellowstone.

<p>At times the Absaroka volcanic eruptions were violently
explosive, showering the countryside with rock bombs, cinders,
and ash. The finer debris that reached the lower slopes
of the volcanoes was reworked and carried by streams into
the intervening valleys, where it was deposited as sand and
gravel (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>). Eventually the entire Yellowstone region
was choked with volcanic debris, the material from one volcano
mixing with that from neighboring volcanoes. Even
the mountain masses uplifted during the preceding Laramide
orogeny were covered by the vast accumulation (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Absaroka volcanism, however, was not a simple, continuous
process&mdash;the eruptions were intermittent, the many
volcanoes were not always active at the same time, and between
eruptions there were long periods of quiescence during
which the erupted material was deeply eroded. The repetitive
nature of the eruptions is best illustrated by the famous fossil
forests of Yellowstone. Here is striking evidence that enough
time elapsed between eruptions for widespread forests to
become established on the lower slopes of the volcanoes and
in the broad valleys between them. Judged from the great
size of some of the now-petrified logs (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>), several hundreds
of years must have passed before another volcanic outburst
smothered the forest. Many different forest layers have
been recognized in the Specimen Ridge area as well as in
several other places throughout the Park.</p>
<p>As the Absaroka magma rose from deep underground,
some of it squirted, like toothpaste, into the layered Paleozoic
and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks through which it passed.
These relatively small masses of molten rock material slowly
cooled and crystallized to form intrusive igneous rocks such
as diorite (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>). The resulting intrusive bodies, called
<i>sills</i>, <i>dikes</i>, <i>stocks</i>, and <i>laccoliths</i>, depending on their form,
are most abundant in the Gallatin Range and in the vicinity
of the East Entrance (<a href="#map1">pl. 1</a>). At the conclusion of volcanic
activity, the last of the rising magma solidified in the main
conduits to form slender, somewhat cylindrical bodies of
rock called <i>volcanic necks</i> that probably conform closely to
the shape of the original conduits. The circular intrusive rock
body at Bunsen Peak (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>), now exposed to view because
erosion has stripped away the lava and volcanic breccia that
once completely buried it, represents either a volcanic neck
or a small stock that solidified directly beneath a volcano.</p>

It is evident that more than one &ldquo;forest&rdquo; is represented in this view. Prof. Erling
Dorf, of Princeton University, counted a total of 27 different forest layers in the rocks

<p>Mount Washburn is the north half of one of the ancient
Absaroka volcanoes (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), and many of the rocks and
other features related to this volcano, which characterized
this great period of volcanism, can be seen along the road
between Canyon Village and Tower. In roadcuts just south
of Dunraven Pass several thin igneous dikes cut through
volcanic breccias. These dikes radiate outward from the nearby
central core of the volcano, which lies east of the highway
in the vicinity of Washburn Hot Springs. From Dunraven
Pass northward for 2-3 miles, the road is lined with lava
flows and very coarse breccias that accumulated close to the
volcanic neck (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>). Farther north toward Tower Falls,
breccias and conglomerates predominate, but the average size
of individual rock fragments decreases gradually northward
away from the center of eruption. Beds of sandstone then
begin to appear in the sequence, having been deposited
mainly by streams that drained the north slope of the volcano.</p>

The landscape must have appeared as a gently rolling

here and there by volcanoes still rising above the general level
of the ground. This plateau surface, however, probably stood
at a maximum of only a few thousand feet above sea level,

volcanic rocks indicate that warm-temperature to even subtropical
climates existed during the volcanic period (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>).</p>

(foreground) that is covered by flows of younger basalt. The Yellowstone Tuff, formed
by volcanic ash and dust exploded from the central Yellowstone region to the south,
underlies the basalt. When erupted, the volcanic debris (as well as the basalt lava)
flowed around this high-standing peak. (Fig. 21)</p>

<h3 id="c10">A quiet period</h3>
<p>Little is known in detail of the geologic events in Yellowstone
during Oligocene and Miocene times. Rocks of these
ages have not been recognized within the Park; if ever deposited
there, they have since been removed by erosion or
buried by younger volcanic rocks. Thus, we can only speculate
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
as to what events took place during this 25-million-year
period. No doubt the broad Absaroka volcanic plateau was
eroded, but not deeply, because the topographic relief and
stream gradients of the region remained low. There are also
hints that some volcanic activity took place, for volcanic
rocks representing parts of this time interval occur south of
the Park, and some of these rocks may have originated within
the Park area. Little transpired, however, to significantly alter
the existing geological makeup of the Park; it was indeed a
quiet time, particularly when compared with the extremely
dynamic periods which immediately preceded and followed it.</p>
<h3 id="c11">More mountain building and deep erosion</h3>
<p>Many features of the present-day landscape of Yellowstone
stem from Pliocene time, about 10 million years ago.
At that time the entire region&mdash;in fact, much of the Rocky
Mountain chain&mdash;was being uplifted by giant earth movements
to heights several thousand feet above its previous
level. This episode of regional uplift accounts in large measure
for the present high average elevation of the Yellowstone
country. Although the precise cause of the uplift is unknown,
the uplift assuredly reflects profound changes that were taking
place deep within or beneath the earth&rsquo;s crust.</p>
<p>Great tensional forces, operating during Pliocene time,
pulled the Yellowstone region apart and partially broke it
into large steep-sided blocks bounded by <i>normal faults</i> (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>).
Some blocks sank while others rose, commonly on the
order of several thousand feet. The Gallatin Range, in the
northwest corner of the Park, for example, was lifted as a
rectangular mountain block along north-trending 20-mile-long
normal faults that border it on each side (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>, section
A-A&prime;; <a href="#map1">pl. 1</a>). In the south-central part of the Park, the
differential movements between several adjacent fault blocks
totaled more than 15,000 feet (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>, section C-C&prime;).
Farther south, the Teton Range moved up and the floor of
Jackson Hole moved down along a normal-fault zone that
stretches along the east foot of the range. An enormous offset
of about 30,000 feet developed between the two crustal
blocks, accounting in large part for the now incredibly steep
and rugged east face of the Teton Range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The pronounced rise in elevation of the general ground
surface and the chopping of the region into many mountainous
fault blocks caused a profound increase in the rate
of erosion. Once-sluggish streams turned into vigorous, fast-moving
rivers that began to cut deeply into the Absaroka
volcanic plateau. Huge quantities of rock debris were stripped
off and carried out of the area, and at the end of the Pliocene,
the Yellowstone region must have been very highly dissected
mountains and table- and canyon-lands. Much of the landscape
may have resembled the rugged terrain now seen in the
Absaroka Range along the east side of the Park. These
mountains (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>), and the Washburn Range in the interior
of the Park (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), today represent but small remnants
of the vast pile of Absaroka volcanic rocks that once covered
all of Yellowstone and the surrounding regions.</p>

<h2 class="pcap" id="c12">Formation of the Yellowstone Caldera</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="200" />
</div>
<p>We have now approached that point in geologic time&mdash;the
beginning of the Quaternary Period between 2 million
and 3 million years ago&mdash;when the stage was set for the
triggering of those all-important events that culminated in
the development of the 1,000-square-mile Yellowstone caldera
and ultimately gave rise to the world-renowned hot-water and
steam phenomena. Involved were some of the earth&rsquo;s biggest
explosions, which have had no apparent counterpart in recorded
human history. A few extremely explosive eruptions
have occurred historically, however, such as the one that took
place on the uninhabited island of Krakatoa, between Java
and Sumatra in the East Indies, during the latter part of
August 1883. For several days this island had been shaken by
a series of violent explosions. Then, on August 27, it was
ripped by an explosion that was heard as far away as Australia,
a distance of about 3,000 miles. Fifty-mile-high dust clouds
became windborne around the globe, producing colorful sunrises
and sunsets in all parts of the world for several years.
When the air around Krakatoa finally cleared, it was found
that two-thirds of the island, some 12 square miles, had collapsed
and vanished into the sea. Though the Krakatoa eruption
resulted in a caldera that is only a small fraction of the
size of the one in Yellowstone, it provides a mental picture
to help us understand what has been discovered about the
great volcanic holocaust in Yellowstone National Park that
was described briefly in an early part of this report.</p>

600,000 years ago. The two oval-shaped areas are resurgent domes that arched the
caldera floor over twin magma chambers after the eruption. The margins of the
resurgent domes are surrounded by ring fracture zones which extend outward toward
the edge of the caldera. Numerous fractures in these zones provided escape routes
through which lavas of the Plateau Rhyolite oozed to the surface and poured out across
the caldera floor. Today these zones also provide underground channels for the
circulation of hot water in the Yellowstone thermal system. The area outlined by the

<p class="tb">Near the beginning of the Quaternary Period a vast
quantity of molten rock had again accumulated deep within
the earth beneath Yellowstone. This time, in contrast to
Absaroka volcanism, the magma was charged with highly explosive
materials which eventually caused two caldera-making
eruptions, one 2,000,000 years ago and the other 600,000 years
ago. Because both eruptions affected the central part of the
Park, the features related to the older one were largely destroyed
by the activity associated with the younger one. Thus,
the outline of the volcanic caldera we now see in the Yellowstone
landscape is chiefly the one that formed 600,000 years
ago (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). The sequence of events described in the following
pages, and illustrated diagrammatically in <a href="#fig23">figure 23</a>,
is based on studies of this later eruption; the pattern for the
2,000,000-year-old eruption probably was similar.</p>
<h3 id="c13">The eruption</h3>
<p>The giant reservoir of molten rock that built up beneath
the Park area fed two large magma chambers that rose to
within a few thousand feet of the surface. As the pressures
increased, the overlying ground arched, stretched, and cracked
(<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>A). Small amounts of lava began to flow out through
the cracks in places, but finally, in a great surge of rapid,
violently explosive eruptions, first from one chamber and
then the other, mountains of hot pumice, ash, and rock
debris spewed from the earth (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>B). The dense, swirling
masses of erupted material spread out across the countryside
in extremely fast moving <i>ash flows</i>, swept along by hot expanding
gases trapped within them. Large quantities of ash
and dust were also blown high into the air and dispersed by
the wind. Thin layers of airborne volcanic ash from Yellowstone
are now found throughout much of the central and
western United States.</p>
<p>The ash flows (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>B), as they sped across the Yellowstone
countryside, first filled the old canyons and valleys that
had been eroded into the Absaroka volcanic pile and older
rocks during Pliocene time. Eventually much of this older
landscape was buried by ash. Some of the larger highlands,
such as Mount Washburn and adjacent ridges and Bunsen
Peak, however, stood well above the level of the sweeping
ash flows; so the debris flowed around them rather than across
them (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>). Finally coming to rest, the hot pumice, ash,
and rock particles settled down in vast horizontal sheets
(<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>). Upon cooling and crystallizing, the particles welded
together to form a series of compact rocks with the composition
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
of rhyolite (figs. <a href="#fig15">15</a> and <a href="#fig25">25</a>). The term &ldquo;ash-flow tuff&rdquo;
(also, the term &ldquo;welded tuff&rdquo;) is commonly used to describe
these rocks, which now make up the Yellowstone Tuff (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c14">The collapse</h3>
<p>With the sudden removal of hundreds of cubic miles of
molten rock from underground, the roofs of the twin magma
chambers collapsed. Enormous blocks of rock fell in above
each of the chambers, and a great crater, or <i>caldera</i>, broke the
ground surface in central Yellowstone (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>C). The exact
depth to which the original surface collapsed is unknown,
but it must have been several thousand feet. The subsidence
took place chiefly along large vertical, or normal, faults in the
ring fracture zones above the margins of the magma chambers
(<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). Abundant, though less extensive, normal faults also
formed outside the caldera proper, as the surrounding areas
adjusted to the staggering impact of the explosive eruptions
and subsequent collapse.</p>
<p>Because the Yellowstone caldera now lies partly buried
by thick lava flows, the appearance of the caldera today is not
nearly as impressive as it must have been when the caldera
was first formed. Many of the important features, however,
are particularly well exposed in the vicinity of Canyon Village
(<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>). The steep south slope of the nearby Washburn
Range (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) marks the north edge of the caldera, and the
range itself stands high because it was not involved in the
collapse. Canyon Village, on the other hand, lies at a much
lower elevation within the caldera proper. Turnouts on the
road just south of Dunraven Pass provide especially fine views
of the northern part of the caldera, and on a clear day Flat
Mountain and the Red Mountains, which mark the south
edge of the caldera, south of Yellowstone Lake, can be seen
50 miles away. As might be expected, the large basin occupied
by Yellowstone Lake owes its existence in part to caldera collapse.
The south edge of the caldera cuts across the south-central
part of the lake, along Flat Mountain Arm and the
north tip of the Promontory; the east edge coincides approximately
with the east edge of the lake north of Southeast Arm
(<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>). Also, the prominent bluffs north of the Madison
River near Madison Junction mark part of the north rim of
the caldera.</p>

<p class="pcapc">A, A large magma chamber formed deep within the earth, and the molten rock began
to force its way slowly toward the surface. As it pushed upward, it arched the
overlying rocks into a broad dome. The arching produced a series of concentric
fractures, or a ring fracture zone, around the crest of the dome. The fractures
extended downward toward the top of the magma chamber.</p>

which contained a high proportion of dissolved gases. With the sudden release of
pressure, tremendous amounts of hot gases and molten rock were erupted almost
instantly. The liquid solidified into pumice, ash, and dust as it was blown out. Some
of the dust and ash was blown high into the air and carried along by the wind, but
much of the debris moved outward across the landscape as vast ash flows, covering
thousands of square miles very rapidly.</p>

<p>The final violent eruption 600,000 years ago, although
releasing much of the explosive energy of the gases contained
in the magma, did not quell all potential volcanic activity in
the twin chambers. Molten rock again rose in both of them,
and in a few hundreds or thousands of years the overlying
caldera floor was domed over the two chambers. One of these
prominent domes lies near Old Faithful and the other east
of Hayden Valley (figs. <a href="#fig22">22</a> and <a href="#fig23">23</a>D). Soon, too, the magma
found its way upward through the wide ring fracture zones
encircling the caldera. Pouring out rather quietly from many
openings (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>D), the lavas flooded the caldera floor and
began to fill the still-smoldering pit. The first lavas appeared
soon after the collapse 600,000 years ago, and the latest ones
only 60,000-75,000 years ago. The flows were confined chiefly
to the caldera proper, but here and there they spilled out
across the rim, particularly toward the southwestern part of
the Park (<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>). Some flows also erupted along fractures
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
outside the caldera, the most prominent flow being the very
famous one at Obsidian Cliff (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>).</p>

<p>The chief rock type in the lava flows is rhyolite, similar
in composition to the welded tufts erupted earlier but different
in other major characteristics. The rock, for example,
shows much contorted layering as evidence of having flowed
as a thick liquid across the ground (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>). A coarse brecciated
texture is also a common feature, well shown by lavas
along the Firehole Canyon drive (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>). Locally, some parts
of the flows cooled so rapidly that few crystals formed, and
the lava solidified mainly into a natural glass (<a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>).</p>

<p>About 30 different flows have been recognized. Grouped
within a major rock unit called the Plateau Rhyolite (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>),
they cover more than 1,000 square miles. The gently rolling
plateau surface of central Yellowstone, broken here and there
by clusters of low-lying hills and ridges, is essentially the landscape
that characterized the upper surfaces of the lava flows
soon after they cooled and solidified. Natural valleys formed
between some of the adjacent flows, and in places streams still
follow these readymade channels. Rhyolite, in both lava flows
and ash-flow tuffs, is by far the predominant rock type seen
along the Park roads.</p>
<p>Several basalt flows were erupted along with the more
common rhyolite flows, and in the vicinity of Tower Falls
they form some of the most unusual rock units in the whole
Park area (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>). As the flows cooled, contraction cracks
broke the basalt into a series of upright many-sided columns;
from a distance they appear as a solid row of fenceposts. They
are now covered by younger rocks, but if one could see the
upper flat surface of the basalt layers where just the ends of
the columns are sticking out, the pattern would be like that
seen in a honeycomb.</p>
<p>During the eruptions of the Plateau Rhyolite, at least
one relatively small caldera-making event occurred in the
central Yellowstone region. This &ldquo;inner&rdquo; caldera developed
sometime between 125,000 and 200,000 years ago, forming the
deep depression now filled by the West Thumb of Yellowstone
Lake (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). Like the main Yellowstone caldera, but
on a much smaller scale, it formed as a direct result of the
explosive eruption of rhyolitic ash flows and subsequent collapse
of an oval-shaped area approximately 4 miles wide and
6 miles long. West Thumb is nearly the same size as Crater
Lake, Oregon, which occupies one of the world&rsquo;s best-known
calderas.</p>
<p>With the outpouring of the last lava flows 60,000-75,000
years ago, the forces of Quaternary volcanism finally died
down. The hot-water and steam activity, however, still remains
as a vivid reminder of Yellowstone&rsquo;s volcanic past. But
who can say even now that we are witnessing the final stage
of volcanism? Someday, quite conceivably, there might be
yet another outburst of molten rock&mdash;only time, of course,
will tell.</p>

<p>The many episodes of mountain building and volcanism
all left their lasting and unmistakable imprints across the
face of the Yellowstone country. During the latter part of the
Tertiary Period, erosion, too, had begun to make its own
deep marks. But only in the last 100,000 years or so have the
powerful exterior forces of the earth&mdash;chiefly running water
and moving ice&mdash;had a virtually free hand in shaping the
Park&rsquo;s landscape. Nevertheless, in this short period of time
they have wrought profound changes.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Glaciation</h3>
<p>A giant boulder of Precambrian gneiss lies among the
trees beside the road leading to Inspiration Point on the
north rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>).
This boulder, measuring approximately 24&times;20&times;18 feet and
weighing at least 500 tons, is of considerable interest, not so
much for its great size but because it is completely out-of-place
in its present surroundings. The boulder rests on
rhyolite lava flows of Quaternary age, at least 15 miles from
the nearest outcrops of the ancient gneiss to the north and
northeast. Obviously, this seemingly immovable chunk of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
rock was pushed or carried a long way by some very powerful
transporting agent before it was finally dropped. A natural
force of such magnitude could only have been exerted by
moving ice; in fact, no further proof than this one boulder
is needed for us to conclude beyond question that glaciers
once existed in Yellowstone. There is, to be sure, much additional
evidence that the Park region was extensively glaciated.
Deposits of out-of-place boulders (<i>glacial erratics</i>), like the
one mentioned above, are found nearly everywhere (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>)
and the mountains and high valleys still bear the vivid scars
of ice sculpturing (figs. <a href="#fig36">36</a> and <a href="#fig37">37</a>).</p>

carried or pushed was at least 15 miles. (Fig. 34)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The principal requirement for the formation of glaciers
is simple: more snow has to accumulate during the winter
than is melted during the summer. If this condition continues
for a long enough period of time (measured in centuries),
the snow compacts to ice, and extensive icefields grow until
they finally begin to move under their own weight, thereby
becoming glaciers. Records show that the average year-round
temperature is 32&deg;-33&deg;F along Yellowstone Lake, 35&deg;F at
Old Faithful, and 39&deg;F at Mammoth. Each winter, snow
accumulates to depths of 5-10 feet throughout much of the
Park. If the average annual temperatures were to decrease a
few degrees or the yearly snowfall were to increase a foot or
so, either change could possibly herald the beginning of another
ice age in the Yellowstone region.</p>
<p>Yellowstone was glaciated at least three times. These
glaciations are, from oldest to youngest, the pre-Bull Lake,
Bull Lake, and Pinedale. Their precise age and duration are
imperfectly known, but estimates based on a few radiometric
determinations are: (1) the oldest glaciation (pre-Bull Lake
glaciation) began more than 300,000 years ago and ended
between 180,000 and 200,000 years ago; (2) Bull Lake Glaciation
began about 125,000 years ago and ended more than
45,000 years ago; (3) Pinedale Glaciation began about 25,000
years ago and ended about 8,500 years ago. The pre-Bull Lake
and Bull Lake are known only from scattered deposits of
rock debris (<i>glacial moraines</i>) and other features, but the
distribution of these deposits indicates that glaciers were
widespread throughout the region and occurred both between
and during eruptions of the Plateau Rhyolite. The effects of
the Pinedale glaciers, on the other hand, are obvious in many
parts of the Park, and the history of this youngest glacial
cycle (described below) is known in much greater detail than
that of the two older ones.</p>
<p>In the early stages of Pinedale Glaciation, an enormous
icefield built up in the high Absaroka Range southeast of the
Park area. A glacier, fed by this icefield, flowed northward
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
down the upper Yellowstone valley and into the basin now
occupied by Yellowstone Lake. At about the same time, another
great icefield formed in the mountains north of the
Park and sent long tongues of ice southward toward the lower
Yellowstone and Lamar River valleys. Smaller valley glaciers
flowed westward out of the Absaroka Range along the east
edge of the Park, and still others formed along the main
ridges and valleys of the Gallatin Range, in the northwestern
part of the Park. Thus, many huge masses of ice from the
north, east, and southeast converged and met in the Park.
At this stage, probably about 15,000 years ago, only the west
edge of the Park, and perhaps a few of the highest peaks and
ridges within the Park, remained free of ice. It is interesting
to note that although ice moved across and buried the ancestral
Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, it did not flow down
and scour the canyon (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>). If it had, the canyon would
look much different than it does today (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">GLACIATED TERRAIN along the Northeast Entrance road. The boulders, many of them
measuring 10 feet across or more, were carried into the area by ice flowing down
Slough Creek from mountains north of the Park during the Pinedale Glaciation.
As the glaciers melted, the boulders were left stranded in hummocky, morainal
deposits. Shallow depressions in the irregular topography are now commonly filled
by small ponds. (Fig. 35)</p>
</div>
<p>For the next 10,000 years, the ice thickened and spread
out over more and more of the Park area. The mass centered
over the Yellowstone Lake basin grew to a depth of 3,000
feet or more and dominated the entire scene; it formed a
broad &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; of ice which became so high that it caused
more snow to fall upon itself and was cold enough to prevent
much of this snow from melting. Eventually the Pinedale
glaciers covered about 90 percent of Yellowstone (<a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>).</p>

intrusive igneous rocks. The rocks in the cirque walls are chiefly Cretaceous shales
(light to moderately dark color) with thin sills of igneous rock (very dark color).

<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>After their maximum advance, the Pinedale glaciers
began to melt, leaving behind the rock debris they had gouged
from the landscape and had pushed or carried along with
them. These glacial moraines are now found in many areas
throughout the Park. In places, glacial ice and (or) rock
debris formed natural dams across stream valleys, thereby
impounding lakes. Parts of Hayden Valley, for example, contain
layers of very fine sand, silt, and clay several tens of feet
thick (<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>) that accumulated along the bottom of a large
lake. This lake formed behind a glacial dam across the Yellowstone
River near Upper Falls. Some of the glacial dams broke
and released water catastrophically, causing giant floods; the
occurrence of one such flood is particularly evident along the
Yellowstone River valley near Gardiner, Montana.</p>
<p>By about 12,000 years ago the thick Pinedale ice sheet
had melted entirely from the Yellowstone Lake basin and
most other areas of the Park, although valley glaciers continued
to exist in the mountains until about 8,500 years ago.
Then, following a short period of total disappearance, small
icefields formed again in the heads of some of the higher
mountain valleys. Since the melting of the Pinedale ice, however,
none has descended as a glacier into the lower stretches
of the valleys. Even though a few snowfields persist locally
throughout the summers (except during the warmest years),
no glaciers exist in the Park at the present time.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3 id="c18">Running water&mdash;canyons and waterfalls</h3>
<p>Yellowstone is, among its many attributes, the source of
large and mighty rivers. Located across the Continental Divide,
the Park feeds two of the most extensive drainage
systems in the nation&mdash;(1) the Missouri River system (and
ultimately the Mississippi River) on the Atlantic side, via
the Yellowstone, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers, and (2) the
Columbia River system on the Pacific side, via the Snake
River (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). These streams are fed by an annual precipitation
which averages about 17 inches at Old Faithful and
Mammoth, but which is considerably greater in the mountain
ranges.</p>
<p>Many stretches of the main river valleys in Yellowstone
are broad and flat bottomed. In these, the stream gradients
range from about 10 to 30 feet per mile, and there is little
erosion going on at present (Hayden Valley is a good example,
<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). But here and there the gradients are steeper, and
the valleys are narrow and rugged. In some places these
streams drop 50 or even 100 feet per mile, and the fast-moving
waters have carved deep V-shaped gorges (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>).</p>
<p>Waterfalls, features for which Yellowstone is also justly
famous (<a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>), generally result from abrupt differences in
rock hardness. If a stream flows over rocks that are more
resistant to erosion than the rocks immediately downstream,
a ledge or bench will form across the streambed at that place
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
because the less resistant rocks are worn away faster. And,
as the ledge becomes higher, the softer downstream rocks will
erode even faster. A true waterfall is one in which there is
a free, vertical fall of water. If the ledge or ledges form only
a rough, steep runway in the streambed, then the term
&ldquo;rapids&rdquo; or &ldquo;cascades&rdquo; is more appropriate.</p>
<p>The existence of many waterfalls in Yellowstone today
is due in large part to the fact that, because of recent volcanism
and glaciation, much of the region&rsquo;s topography is very
young in terms of geologic time. Streams, even some of the
largest ones, have not had enough time to wear away all the
features that may produce waterfalls, cascades, or rapids along
their channels. This is particularly true along the margins of
lava flows, where there are sharp dropoffs between the tops
of the flows and the lower ground beyond. The Grand Canyon
of the Yellowstone and the Upper and Lower Falls, well
illustrate the erosive power of running water.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</h3>
<p>Except for Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone
is probably the best known and most talked about
and photographed feature in the Park (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>). Although not
so deep or wide as some of the other great canyons in America,
its sheer ruggedness and beauty are breathtaking. Here the
aptness of the name &ldquo;Yellowstone&rdquo; can be fully appreciated
and understood, for the viewer is at once engulfed in a sea of
yellow hues streaked and tinted with various shades of red
and brown.</p>

Nevertheless, it is apparent that certain unusual conditions
caused the river, after winding slowly through flat-floored
Hayden Valley for about 13 miles, to cut a precipitous gorge
1,000-1,500 feet deep and 20 miles long (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>C). A full
explanation must be based on all the many events surrounding
the eruption of the Yellowstone Tuff, the collapse of the
Yellowstone caldera, the outpouring of the Plateau Rhyolite,
and the various episodes of glaciation. Geologic studies show
that all these events took place while the canyon was being
cut, and that each one played an important role in its development.
Hot-water and steam activity likewise was a significant
factor. However, despite its many complexities, the history
of the Grand Canyon can be divided into a few major stages,
as outlined below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. From more than 2,000,000 years ago to about 600,000
years ago, a shallow canyon was gradually being cut into
the Absaroka volcanic sequence by the ancestral Yellowstone
River as it eroded headward from a point near the
present confluence of the Yellowstone and Lamar Rivers
(<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>). By the time of the climactic volcanic eruption
in central Yellowstone 600,000 years ago, the head of the
&ldquo;old&rdquo; canyon probably had been eroded southward nearly
to the place where the north rim of the Yellowstone caldera
was to form later (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>A). This point now lies
about 5 miles below Lower Falls.</p>
<p>2. Ash-flow tuffs that were erupted 600,000 years ago filled
the &ldquo;old&rdquo; canyon, and the river recarved its channel,
chiefly along its previous course.</p>
<p>3. A large lake formed behind (south of) the north rim of
the caldera, the damming resulting in part from lava flows
of Plateau Rhyolite that poured out across the caldera
floor in this area between 600,000 and 500,000 years ago.
Eventually the lake rose and spilled northward into the
head of the &ldquo;old&rdquo; canyon, causing additional downcutting
in what is now the lower 15-mile stretch of the canyon.</p>
<p>4. As the lake emptied, the river began to erode upstream
into the thick rhyolite lava flows toward the present site
of Lower Falls; the process was very similar to that of a
common stream gully eroding headward into a hillside.
At a stage somewhat more than 300,000 years ago, the
head of the canyon probably lay near the falls, and the
river had cut a channel 400-600 feet deep along this
upper 5-mile stretch (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>B).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>5. Approximately 300,000 years ago the canyon area was
covered by ice during pre-Bull Lake glaciation. During
and after the retreat of this ice, sediments accumulated
in a lake that occupied the upper reaches of the canyon
between the present site of Upper Falls and Inspiration
Point. Subsequently, very little downcutting was accomplished
until about 150,000-125,000 years ago, when the
canyon was eroded nearly to its present depth.</p>
<p>6. Canyon development was further interrupted by the advance
and retreat of glaciers during Bull Lake and Pinedale
Glaciations. During and since the melting of the
Pinedale glaciers about 12,000 years ago, the canyon has
attained its present depth, and its walls have acquired
much of their picturesque erosional form. The Yellowstone
River now maintains a fairly uniform gradient
(60-80 feet per mile) throughout the 20-mile-long gorge,
even though different segments of the canyon were cut
at different times and through different kinds of rocks
(<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>C).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spectacular erosional development in the upper
5-mile segment of the Grand Canyon, which is the only part
seen by most Park visitors, except for the very lower end
near Tower Falls (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>), has taken place mostly within the
past 150,000-125,000 years. One reason for such a rapid rate
of erosion stems from the fact that this part of the canyon
overlies one of the wide ring fracture zones of the Yellowstone
caldera (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). The fracture zone extends to great depth,
providing a ready avenue of travel for the upflow of hot water
and steam rising in the Yellowstone thermal system, as described
in the following chapter. Through many thousands
of years, the upward percolation of the hot fluids has caused
severe chemical and physical changes (known as <i>hydrothermal
alteration</i>) in the rhyolite lava flows. One spectacular
result of the alteration has been the change from the normal
brown and gray color of the rhyolites to the bright yellow
and other colorful hues now seen in the canyon walls (as
well as in many other places throughout the Park). Another
significant result of alteration has been the weakening of the
rocks; that is, the altered rocks are softer and less resistant
to erosion than unaltered rocks. Hence, the river has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
able to erode these softer rocks, upstream to Lower Falls, at
a very rapid rate.</p>
<p>The position of Lower Falls, as might be expected, coincides
with a change from highly altered to less altered rhyolite;
the difference in the erosion rates of the two kinds of rocks
here is self-evident (figs. <a href="#fig41">41</a> and <a href="#fig42">42</a>C). The position of Upper
Falls is likewise closely controlled by differences in rock hardnesses.
The rhyolites on the upstream side are hard and dense,
whereas those on the downstream side contain a high proportion
of volcanic glass which causes them to be more easily
eroded (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>C).</p>

</div>
<p>Although Yellowstone is geologically outstanding in
many ways, the great abundance, diversity, and spectacular
nature of its thermal (hot-water and steam) features were
undoubtedly the primary reasons for its being set aside as our
first National Park (<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>). The unusual concentration of
geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles provides that
special drawing card which has, for the past century, made
the Park one of the world&rsquo;s foremost natural attractions.</p>
<p>To count all the individual thermal features in Yellowstone
would be virtually impossible. Various estimates range
from 2,500 to 10,000, depending on how many of the smaller
features are included. They are scattered through many regions
of the Park, but most are clustered in a few areas called
geyser basins, where there are continuous displays of intense
thermal activity. (See <a href="#pic1">frontispiece</a>.) The &ldquo;steam&rdquo; that can be
seen in thermal areas is actually fog or water droplets condensed
from steam; so the appearance of individual geyser
basins depends largely on air temperature and humidity. On
a warm, dry summer day, for example, the activity may seem
very weak (<a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a>), except where individual geysers are
erupting. On cold or very humid days, however, &ldquo;steam&rdquo;
plumes are seen rising from every quarter.</p>
<h3 id="c21">How a thermal system operates</h3>
<p>An essential ingredient for thermal activity is heat.
A body of buried molten rock, such as the one that produced
volcanic eruptions in Yellowstone as late as 60,000 to 75,000
years ago, takes a long time to cool. During cooling, tremendous
quantities of heat are transmitted by conduction into
the solid rocks surrounding the magma chamber (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>).
Eventually the whole region becomes much hotter than non-volcanic
areas (<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>). Normally, rock temperatures increase
about 1&deg;F per 100 feet of depth in the earth&rsquo;s crust, but in
the thermally active areas of Yellowstone the rate of temperature
increase is much greater. The amount of heat given off
by the Upper Geyser Basin, for example, is 800 times the
amount given off by normal (nonthermal) areas of the same
size. This excess heat is enough to melt 1&frac12; tons of ice per
second! And, contrary to popular opinion, the underground
temperatures have not cooled measurably in the 100 years
that records have been kept on the thermal activity in the
Park. In fact, geologic studies indicate that very high heat
flows have continued for at least the past 40,000 years.</p>

the most active thermal areas in Yellowstone, but the photograph was taken on a
warm dry summer day when little hot-water and steam activity was visible from a
distance. Clouds of water droplets (the visible &ldquo;steam&rdquo; in thermal areas) normally
form only when the air is cool and (or) moist. The floor of the basin is covered by a
nearly solid layer of hot-spring deposits. (Fig. 44)</p>

(Fig. 46)</p>
</div>
<p>A second, equally essential ingredient for thermal activity
is water. Many thousands of gallons are discharged by
the hot springs and geysers in Yellowstone every minute&mdash;where
does all this water come from? Studies show that nearly
all the water originates above ground as rain or snow (meteoric
water; <a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>), and that very little comes from the
underlying magma (magmatic water).</p>
<p>The mechanism for heating the water, on the other hand,
is a matter of some uncertainty. Until a few years ago the
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
heating was assumed to occur near the ground surface and
to be caused by hot magmatic gases (mostly steam) rising
from the underlying magma chamber. Deep wells drilled
recently in many thermal areas throughout the world (including
research drill holes in Yellowstone), however, suggest
a better explanation. According to this explanation, the surface
water enters underground passages (fractures and faults)
and circulates to great depths&mdash;as much as 5,000-10,000 feet
in some areas (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>)&mdash;there to become heated far above
its surface boiling point. Research drill holes in Yellowstone,
for example, have demonstrated that water of surface origin
exists at all depths at least to the maximum drilled (1,088
feet), and that the water reaches temperatures up to at least
465&deg;F. The increase in temperature with depth causes a corresponding
decrease in the weight (density) of the water.
Because of this, the hot, &ldquo;lighter,&rdquo; water begins to rise again
toward the ground surface, pushed upward by the colder,
&ldquo;heavier,&rdquo; near-surface water which sinks to keep the water
channels filled. Thus is set into motion a giant <i>convection
current</i> which operates continuously to supply very hot
water to the thermal areas (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>). Just how deep the waters
circulate in Yellowstone no one really knows; as a guess, the
depth probably is at least 1 or 2 miles.</p>
<p>The effect of pressure on the boiling temperature of
water also plays a vital role in thermal activity. In a body of
water, the pressure at the surface is that exerted by the weight
of air above it (<i>atmospheric pressure</i>). Water under these conditions
boils at 212&deg;F at sea level and at about 199&deg;F at the
elevation of most of the geyser basins in Yellowstone. However,
water at depth not only is subjected to atmospheric
pressure but also bears the added weight of the overlying
water. Under such additional pressures, water boils only
when the temperature is raised above its surface boiling point.
In a well 100 feet deep at sea level, for example, the water
at the bottom would have to be heated to 288&deg;F before it
will boil. Thus it follows that in the underground &ldquo;workings&rdquo;
of hot springs or geysers, (1) The deepest water is subjected
to the greatest pressures, and (2) these deeper waters (in
Yellowstone) must be heated well above 199&deg;F before they
can actually begin to boil. By this same reasoning but in
reverse, if the pressure is released, which happens as the water
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
rises toward the ground surface, the &ldquo;hotter-than-boiling&rdquo;
water will then begin to boil. The boiling will be rather
quiet if the pressure is released gradually, as in most hot
springs. But if the pressure is released suddenly, boiling may
become so violent that much of the water flashes explosively
into steam, expanding to several hundred times its normal
volume. This expansion provides the necessary energy for
geyser eruptions.</p>

</div>
<p>Nearly all geysers and many hot springs build mounds or
terraces of mineral deposits; some are so unusual in form
that descriptive names have been given to them, such as
Castle Geyser (<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>). These deposits are generally made
up of many very thin layers of rock. Each layer represents a
crust or film of rock-forming mineral which was originally
dissolved in hot water as it flowed through the underground
rocks, and which was then precipitated as the water spread
out over the surrounding ground surface.</p>

<p class="pcap">Closeup view shows layered and porous nature of the travertine.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>In all major thermal areas of the Park, with the exception
of Mammoth Hot Springs, most of the material being
deposited is <i>sinter</i> (the kind found around geysers is popularly
called <i>geyserite</i>). Its chief constituent is silica (the same
as in quartz and in ordinary window glass). At Mammoth,
the deposit is <i>travertine</i> (<a href="#fig48">fig. 48</a>), which consists almost entirely
of calcium carbonate. The material deposited at any
given place commonly reflects the predominant kind of rock
through which the hot water has passed during its underground
travels. At Mammoth Hot Springs the water passes
through thick beds of limestone (which is calcium carbonate),
but in other areas the main rock type through which
the water percolates is rhyolite, a rock rich in silica.</p>
<p>Through centuries of intense activity, layers of sinter
have built up on the floors of the geyser basins (<a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a>);
these deposits are generally less than 10 feet thick. In one
drill hole at Mammoth, deposits of travertine extend to a
depth of 250 feet. Dead trees and other kinds of vegetation
whose life processes have been choked off by the heat, water,
and precipitated minerals of hot-spring activity are a common
sight in many places (<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>).</p>
<p>Both travertine and sinter are white to gray. Around
active hot springs, however, the terraces that are constantly
under water may be brightly colored (figs. <a href="#fig43">43</a> and <a href="#fig49">49</a>) because
they are coated by microscopic plants called <i>algae</i>. These
organisms, which thrive in hot water at temperatures up to
about 170&deg;F, are green, yellow, and brown. Oxides of iron
and manganese also contribute to the coloring in some parts
of the thermal areas. The delicate blue color of many pools,
however, results from the reflection of light off the pool walls
and back through the deep clear water (<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>). Other pools
are yellow because they contain sulfur, or are green from the
combined influence of yellow sulfur and &ldquo;blue&rdquo; water.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h3 id="c23">Hot springs and geysers</h3>
<p>Hot springs occur where the rising hot waters of a thermal
system issue from the ground-level openings of the feeder
conduits (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>). By far the greatest numbers discharge
water and steam in a relatively steady noneruptive manner,
although they vary considerably in individual behavior. Depending
upon pressure, water temperature, rate of upflow,
heat supply, and arrangement and size of underground passages,
some hot springs boil violently and emit dense clouds
of vapor whereas in others the water quietly wells up with
little agitation from escaping steam. In some hot springs,
however, the underground channels are too narrow or the
upflow of very hot water and steam is too great to permit a
steady discharge; periodic eruptions then result. These special
kinds of springs are called &ldquo;geysers&rdquo; (from the Icelandic word
<i>geysir</i>, meaning to &ldquo;gush&rdquo; or &ldquo;rage&rdquo;). At least 200 geysers, of
which about 60 play to a height of 10 feet or more, occur in
Yellowstone National Park; this is more than in any other
region of the world.</p>
<p>How does a geyser work? We cannot, of course, observe
the inner plumbing of a geyser, except for that part which is
seen by looking into its uppermost &ldquo;well.&rdquo; Deeper levels
directly below the &ldquo;well&rdquo; can be probed by scientific instruments
to some extent, and research drilling in some parts of
the geyser basins also provides much useful information. The
available information suggests that the plumbing system of a
geyser (1) lies close to the ground surface, generally no deeper
than a few hundred feet; (2) consists of a tube, commonly
nearly vertical, that connects to chambers, side channels, or
layers of porous rock, where substantial amounts of water can
be stored; and (3) connects downward through the central
tube and side channels to narrow conduits that rise from the
deepwater source of the main thermal system.</p>
<p>Considering a geyser system as described above and applying
what is known about the behavior of water and steam, we
can understand what causes a natural thermal eruption. <a href="#fig50">Figure 50</a>
shows diagrammatically the succession of events believed
to occur during the typical eruptive cycle of a geyser
such as Old Faithful.</p>

<p class="pcapc">Stage 1 (Recovery or recharge stage). After an eruption, the partly emptied geyser
tubes and chambers fill again with water. Hot water enters through a feeder conduit
from below, and cooler water percolates in from side channels nearer the surface.
Steam bubbles (with some other gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide)
start to form in upflowing currents, as a decrease in pressure causes a corresponding
decrease in boiling temperature. At first the bubbles condense in the cooler, near-surface
water that is not yet at boiling temperature, but eventually all water is
heated enough that the bubbles will no longer condense or &ldquo;dissolve.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="pic23">
<img src="images/p42a.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Stage 2 (Preliminary eruption stage). As the rising gas bubbles grow in size and
number, they tend to clog certain parts of the geyser tube, perhaps at some narrow
or constricted point such as at A. When this happens, the expanding steam abruptly
forces its way upward through the system and causes some of the water to discharge
from the surface vent in preliminary spurts. The deeper part of the system, however,
is not yet quite hot enough for &ldquo;triggering.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<div class="img" id="pic24">
<img src="images/p42c.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Stage 3 (Full eruption stage). Finally, a preliminary spurt &ldquo;unloads&rdquo; enough water
(with resulting reduction in pressure) to start a chain reaction deeper in the system.
Larger amounts of water in the side chambers and pore spaces begin to flash into
steam, and the geyser rapidly surges into full eruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="pic25">
<img src="images/p42d.jpg" alt="" width="406" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Stage 4 (Steam stage). When most of the extra energy is spent, and the geyser tubes
and chambers are nearly empty, the eruption ceases. Some water remains in local
pockets and pore spaces, continuing to make steam for a short while. Thereafter the
system begins to fill again, and the eruptive cycle starts anew.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>No two geysers have the same size, shape, and arrangement
of tubes and chambers. Also, some geysers, such as Great
Fountain, have large surface pools not present in cone-type
geysers such as Old Faithful. Hence, each geyser behaves
differently from all others in frequency of eruption, length
of individual eruptions, and amount of water discharged.
Geysers may also vary in their own behavior as their plumbing
features change through the years. The great amount of
energy that builds up in some of them from time to time
creates enough explosive force to shatter parts of the plumbing
system, thereby causing a change in their eruptive behavior.
In fact, some geyser eruptions have been so violent
that large chunks of rock have been exploded out of the
ground and scattered around the surrounding area (<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>).
With time, the precipitation of minerals may partly seal a
tube or chamber, gradually altering the eruptive mechanism.</p>
<p>Despite all the variable factors involved in geyser eruptions,
and all the changes that can take place from time to
time to alter the pattern of those eruptions, several of the
Yellowstone geysers function regularly, day after day, week
after week, and year after year. Within this group of regulars
is the most famous feature of all&mdash;Old Faithful&mdash;which has
not missed an eruption in all the many decades that it has
been under close observation (<a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>). We can only conclude
that nature has provided this incredible geyser with a stable
plumbing system that is just right to trigger delightfully
graceful eruptions at close-enough time intervals to suit the
convenience of all Park visitors.</p>
<h3 id="c24">Mudpots</h3>
<p>Mudpots are among the most fascinating and interesting
of the Yellowstone thermal features. They are also a type of
hot spring, but one for which water is in short supply. Whatever
water is available becomes thoroughly mixed with clay
and other fine undissolved mineral matter. The mud is generally
gray, black, white, or cream colored, but some is tinted
pale pink and red by iron compounds (<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>); hence, the
picturesque term &ldquo;paint pots&rdquo; is commonly used.</p>
<p>Mudpots form in places where the upflowing thermal
fluids have chemically decomposed the surface rocks to form
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
clay. Such small amounts of water are involved, however, that
the surface discharge is not great enough to flush the clay out
of the spring. Caldrons of mud of all consistencies result, from
the very thin soupy material in many mudpots to the almost
hard-baked material in the less active features. Some mudpots
expel pellets of very thick viscous mud which build up circular
cones or mounds; this type is commonly called a &ldquo;mud
volcano&rdquo; (<a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">OLD FAITHFUL IN FULL ERUPTION. The interval between eruptions averages about 65
minutes, but it varies from 33 to 96 minutes. The time lapse between eruptions can
be predicted rather closely, mainly on the basis of the length of time involved in the
previous eruption. If an eruption lasted 4 minutes, for example, this means that a
certain amount of water emptied from the geyser&rsquo;s chambers and that a certain
length of time will be necessary to recharge the system for the next eruption. But if
the previous eruption lasted only 3 minutes, less time will be needed for recharge,
and the next eruption will occur sooner. (The above discussion is based primarily on
many years of observation and study of Old Faithful by George D. Marler and other

<p>Mudpot activity differs from season to season throughout
the year because of the varying amounts of rain and snow that
fall upon the surface to further moisten the mud. Accordingly,
mudpots are commonly drier in late summer and early
fall than they are from winter through early summer.</p>
<h3 id="c25">Fumaroles</h3>
<p>Fumaroles (from the Latin word <i>fumus</i>, meaning
&ldquo;smoke&rdquo;) are those features that discharge only steam and
other gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide;
hence, they are commonly called &ldquo;steam vents.&rdquo; Usually
these features are perched on a hillside or other high ground
above the level of the flowing springs. In many fumaroles,
however, water can be heard boiling violently at some lower,
unseen level.</p>
<h3 id="c26">Thermal explosions</h3>
<p>A few features present in the Yellowstone thermal areas
display evidence that extremely violent thermal explosions
occurred in the past, particularly during Pinedale Glaciation,
about 15,000 years ago. Such explosion features, of which
Pocket Basin in Lower Geyser Basin is a good example,
appear as craterlike depressions a few tens of feet to as much
as 5,000 feet across surrounded by rims of rock fragments
that were blown out of the craters. The underground mechanism
causing the explosions was similar to that of geysers, but
in these special cases the energy remained bottled-up until a
very critical explosive stage was reached.</p>
<p>The best explanation for Pocket Basin and related features
is that the ground above the sites of the explosions was
weighted down by the water of small lakes which had formed
in melted-out pockets of glacial ice. Such localized melting of
the glaciers would occur where the ice was in direct contact
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
with underlying thermal features. A rapid draining of the
lake waters would then produce a sudden release of pressure
over the hot area, resulting in an unusually violent thermal
eruption.</p>

<p class="pcap">MUD VOLCANO near Pocket Basin in the Lower Geyser Basin. The mud is formed by
chemical decomposition of the rocks chiefly by the action of carbon dioxide and
sulfuric acid. The splatter, 5-6 feet high, is caused by the escaping gases. (Fig. 53)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c27">Faulting and its control of thermal activity</h3>
<p>Most of the major thermal areas of Yellowstone are related
to the ring fracture zones of the Yellowstone caldera
(<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). Many deep-seated faults and fractures in these zones
are presumably situated above the main source of heat of the
thermal system. Thus, they provide convenient avenues of
travel for underground waters to circulate to great depths,
there to become heated and then rise to the earth&rsquo;s surface
(<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>). A few areas like Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris
Geyser Basin, on the other hand, are not within the ring
fracture zones of the caldera. In these areas, the thermal
activity is commonly related to other prominent zones of
faulting which also afford readymade channelways for the
circulation of hot water and steam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 class="pcap" id="c28">Earthquakes</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p45a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="276" />
</div>
<p>Earthquakes occur frequently in areas of active faulting
and volcanism; they are caused by sudden movements between
adjacent blocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust as the crust adjusts to new
conditions and pressures. Because of its volcanic history and
the fact that very recent fault movements have occurred there,
it is not surprising that Yellowstone is an especially active
earthquake area. Sensitive instruments (<i>seismographs</i>) record
an average of about five earth tremors daily in and around the
Park, and on rare occasions they may record 100 tremors or
more in a single day. Nearly all these tremors are so slight
that they cannot be felt by man, but at times, perhaps only
once in a human lifetime, one is triggered with high enough
intensity to sharply draw our attention to the very real earthquake
potential that exists constantly in this geologically
active area. Such a high-intensity quake occurred in the Yellowstone
region near midnight on August 17, 1959.</p>
<p>The Hebgen Lake Earthquake, as it is known, was centered
in the Madison Valley along the west boundary of
Yellowstone National Park about 12 miles north of the town
of West Yellowstone, Montana (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). As a result of the
quake, a 200-square-mile area, occupied in part by the Hebgen
Lake reservoir, subsided a foot or more; maximum subsidence
was 20 feet. Movements of several feet along old faults in the
highlands along the north side of the valley produced fresh
scars several miles long (<a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>). Moreover, the severe vibrations
that rocked the surrounding countryside caused the
loose silt, sand, and gravel of the valley floor to slip and
become &ldquo;faulted&rdquo; in many places. By far the most drastic
result was the shaking loose of a huge landslide in the vicinity
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
of the Rock Creek campground about 25 miles downstream
on the Madison River from the west boundary of the Park.</p>

<p class="pcap">EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE. Severe damage caused by reactivation of a fault during the
Hebgen Lake Earthquake of August 17, 1959. The building is on the Blarneystone
Ranch, about 10 miles north of West Yellowstone, Montana, and 1&frac12; miles west of
the west boundary of Yellowstone National Park. (Fig. 54)</p>
</div>
<p>Within Yellowstone National Park, the quake caused
only slight damage to buildings at Old Faithful, Mammoth
Hot Springs, and a few other places. Small landslides also
occurred in various places, for example, at Tuff Cliff near
Madison Junction. The earthquake affected many thermal
features, particularly those in the main geyser basins near
the west side of the Park. In several places the intensity of
the thermal activity increased markedly, in fewer places the
activity decreased. Some geysers, long dormant, erupted immediately
after the earthquake; others erupted with much
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
greater force and frequency than usual; still others became
dormant and have remained so. A general, widespread effect
was a noticeable increase in the muddiness of many pools
and springs, as if the quake had produced a giant surge of
water coursing through the underground channels of the
geyser basins. Of immediate concern to everyone, of course,
was the earthquake&rsquo;s effect on Old Faithful. Fortunately, the
only measurable effect was a slight lengthening of time between
eruptions. After several months the time interval stabilized
at about 65 minutes.</p>
<p>Detailed scientific studies bearing on the Hebgen Lake
Earthquake in the weeks that followed showed that it was
felt over more than 600,000 square miles of the Western
United States, and that it was the strongest shock ever recorded
in this part of the Rocky Mountains. In 12 years&rsquo; time
many traces of the quake have disappeared, but its frightful
aspects will not soon be forgotten. It serves as a vivid reminder,
once again, of the great restlessness that through the ages
has been, and continues to be, the very special trademark of
the Yellowstone country.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><i>The Park <span class="small">and</span> Man</i></h2>
<p>A hundred years ago another powerful force entered the
Yellowstone scene. Man, arriving in ever increasing numbers,
came armed with the power to choose between preserving or
destroying the wonders that nature has taken more than 2.5
billion years to create. Sensing this grave responsibility, he
took the necessary steps to insure that these irreplaceable
natural features would be preserved and protected. Today,
Yellowstone National Park indeed exists &ldquo;for the benefit and
enjoyment of the people,&rdquo; a fitting and lasting symbol of a
great national heritage that now includes more than 275
places of natural and historical interest. On the eve of the
100th anniversary of our first National Park, we are again
reminded of that continuing responsibility we all share in
preserving these unique places for the benefit and enjoyment
of all future generations of visitors.</p>

<h2 id="c30"><i>Acknowledgments</i></h2>
<p>The subject matter of this bulletin is based chiefly on
the results of a systematic program of geological investigations
in Yellowstone National Park, conducted by the U.S.
Geological Survey during the years 1965-71. The program,
ably organized and directed by A. B. Campbell, required the
special skills and knowledge of many individuals to make a
comprehensive study of all the varied and complex features
of the Park area. Without their invaluable cooperation, assistance,
and interest, this endeavor to summarize the geologic
story of Yellowstone would not have been possible. I therefore
express my sincere thanks to the colleagues listed below,
all of whom furnished unpublished information bearing on
different aspects of that story: R. L. Christiansen and H. R.
Blank, Jr. (Quaternary volcanism); H. W. Smedes and H. J.
Prostka (Absaroka volcanism); D. E. White, L. J. P. Muffler,
R. O. Fournier, and A. H. Truesdell (thermal activity);
G. M. Richmond, K. L. Pierce, and H. A. Waldrop (glaciation);
E. T. Ruppel and J. D. Love (sedimentary rocks and
geologic structure); J. D. Obradovich and Meyer Rubin
(radiometric dating). W. L. Newman provided many helpful
suggestions regarding the preparation of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The geological studies in Yellowstone received the full
support and cooperation of former Park Superintendent J. S.
McLaughlin, Superintendent J. K. Anderson, and other personnel
of the U.S. National Park Service. In particular, the
helpful advice, interest, and enthusiasm of the entire Park
Naturalist staff, especially J. M. Good and W. W. Dunmire,
former and present Chief Park Naturalists, respectively,
greatly facilitated the work in all phases of the program.</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The specific area about which the early-day Indians first used the term that is
now translated as &ldquo;Yellowstone&rdquo; is unknown. The name may have referred to the
yellowish rocks that line the banks of the Yellowstone River near its confluence with
the Missouri River in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. However, in the
opinion of H. M. Chittenden, who studied the question in considerable detail, there is
little doubt that the name was taken from the striking yellow-hued walls of the gorge
now known as the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.
